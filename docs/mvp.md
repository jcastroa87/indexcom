| Function ID | Description                                   | User Story                                                                                                                                                           | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FN001       | Viewing Daily Rate & Historical Graph         | As a user, I want to visit pages like `/usd`, `/uf`, or `/bitcoin` to see the current daily rate along with a graph showing its evolution over time.               | The system displays the current daily rate along with an interactive graph depicting the historical trend of the selected index.           |
| FN002       | API Access for Daily Rate Data                | As a developer, I want to retrieve daily rate data via API so that I can integrate this data into other applications or services.                                      | A RESTful endpoint is provided that returns the current daily rate and historical evolution data in JSON format with proper documentation. |
| FN003       | Admin Panel: Enable/Disable Indexes           | As an admin, I want to enable or disable specific indexes through the admin panel to control which indexes are publicly accessible.                                  | The admin panel (using Backpack) displays toggle options for each index. Enabling or disabling an index immediately reflects on both the public website and API responses. |
| FN004       | Admin Panel: Manual Daily Rate Entry          | As an admin, I want to manually input a daily rate when the automatic external API fetch fails, ensuring the platform always shows accurate information.          | The admin panel offers a form to manually update the daily rate for an index, and the manually entered data is displayed on the public-facing pages. |
| FN005       | Admin Panel: User Management                  | As an admin, I want to create users, enable/disable user accounts, and update their API keys for platform access control.                                               | The admin panel includes user management features that allow for account creation, activation status toggles, and API key regeneration; these changes control user access effectively. |
| FN006       | Automatic Data Fetch with Fallback Mechanism    | As a system, I want to automatically fetch daily rate data from an external API and gracefully handle fetch failures by allowing manual intervention.             | The system regularly attempts to update data using the external API. If the API call fails, an alert is provided in the admin panel to prompt manual data entry without service interruption. |
